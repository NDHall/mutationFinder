# Scripts for finding target-site mutations in herbicide-related genes.

#### herbicideMutationFinder_v.0.#.#.py is meant to run in command line and read in ABI files (.ab1).  Run in the command line as follows:

##### python herbicideMutationFinder_v.0.#.#.py <YOURABIFILEHERE>

The script is not written to accept flags at this time.  Give it a try and let me know what you think.  A batch version will be coming soon that can analyze all .ab1 files in a directory and output to a text file.
